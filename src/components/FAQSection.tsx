      question: "How much can I earn per survey?",
      answer: "Your earnings per survey depend on two factors:\n\nYour plan level (higher-tier plans offer higher-paying surveys).\n\nSurvey difficulty (harder surveys pay more than easier ones).\n\nUpgrade your plan to maximize your earnings!"
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get paid?",
      answer: "We pay via mobile money, with M-Pesa as our preferred method. Once you reach the minimum withdrawal threshold, you can cash out your earnings directly to your mobile wallet."
    },

    },
